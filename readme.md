# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-02 Basic Technologies
### 1. SUMMARY

Week two of MART-341 introduced us to the basic technologies that we will work with this semester.
Test file typed covered this week are;

- Text Documents
- Text Editors
- Git Version Control
- Graphical User Interface '**GUI**'
- GitHub
- Markup & Markdown

**Test Documents**- a text document is a document that contains the standard ASCII character set; for example (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and the standard symbols ?!#$...etc)

**Test Editor**- a text editor is the application that is used to edit text documents.

**Git Version Control**- allows editors to track the changes made to a file.

**GUI's**- allows editors to view visual changes, it works as a front-end to Git. Sourcetree and GitHub are examples of a GUI.

**Markup & Markdown**- markup language allows documents and text to be annotated in a syntactically distinguishable way. Markdown is a file with .md extension, which allows editors to easily distinguish portions of text and include photos to a document.

## 3. Issues

The biggest issue I had this week was learning how to push my work to GitHub through sourcetree, to fix this problem I attended a tutorial class, at which I learnt how to use the GitHub desktop. The tutorial was super helpful and I look forward to attending throughout this semster. Another difficulty I faced was remmbering which codes to use when and trying to find which programming editor worked best for me. After much practice with all, I found powershell to be the best for me. I found this link usful!

## 4. Further Discussion

I really enjoyed working with powershell and playing around with it. I would like to learn more about the other codes and functions of powershell so I can use it more accurately.
## 5. Assistance

Unfortunately this week I was unable to help my classmates, as I found it quite difficult myself, however now that the process has become alot clearer to me, I hope to be able to assist my fellow classmates in the coming weeks.
